// Sandwiches: Write a function that accepts a array of items a person wants on a sandwich. The function should have one parameter that collects as many items as the function call provides, and it should print a summary of the sandwich that is being ordered. Call the function three times, using a different number of arguments each time.

function make_sandwich(...items: string[]){
    console.log('\n Making a sandwich with the following item: \n');
    items.forEach(eachitem => console.log(eachitem))
    console.log("Enjoy the sandwich!");
    
    
}

make_sandwich('chicken','tomato','cheese');
make_sandwich('mayo','egg','chicken');
make_sandwich('mayo','cheese','chicken','sauces','Butter','onion','lettuce')
