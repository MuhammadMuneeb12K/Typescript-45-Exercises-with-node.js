// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
 let transportation_modes: string[] = ['Sports Car','Heavy Bike','Bus','Car'];
 transportation_modes.forEach(mode => console.log(`I would like to own a ${mode}.`));
